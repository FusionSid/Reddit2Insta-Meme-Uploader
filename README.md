# Reddit2Insta-Meme-Uploader

I have an insta account where i post memes. 
Normaly i would post memes by surfing reddit, finding somethings i like, downloading it then posting it.
But that takes a lot of time. 
Luckily i like to code so instead of doing all of that im gonna spend 69 hours (haha im so funny with my primary 10 year old humor) coding a bot that can do it for me.

To use this bot just create a .env file and put this in it:

CLIENT_ID = 

CLIENT_SECRET = 

USER_AGENT = memes-fastapi

insta_user = 

insta_pass = 


Ad you api keys and instagram username/pass and it shouls work from there. Any issuses contact me.
